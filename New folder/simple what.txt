A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers because they cannot be evenly divided by any other numbers except 1 and the number itself.

The number 1 is not considered a prime number because it has only one distinct positive divisor (1), and prime numbers, by definition, must have exactly two distinct positive divisors.
